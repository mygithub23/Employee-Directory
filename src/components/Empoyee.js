APIs can be accessed via the https://randomapi.com/api endpoint.
api key: 9U47-0BBT-HR0V-FLXE
Name:   emp-api	
Ref ID: ya1fyg6v
At a minimum, the endpoint requires a key and ref value or a public hash value. 
Key would be your API key and ref is the Ref ID of the API you want to access 
which can be found on the View APIs page.

Public hashes are another way that you can access your API without accidentally 
exposing your API Key and API Ref ID. The user segment of the info block from your 
results will also be removed by default when your API is called using this method. 
They can be found by clicking Run API (public URL) on the View APIs page.
